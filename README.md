This project contains the TypeScript declaration file for the openzwave-shared module. 
So if you want to create a home automtion project with TypeScript & ZWave, this could be usefull.

All methods should be implemented, however didn't fully check the openzwave-shared source code so there could some valid calls that are not yet in the declaration file. 

Feel free to send a patch (pull request) if something is missing that you would like to be added.
